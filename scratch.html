<p>In this game you try to maneuver through a maze as a cat and collect bananas to win.</p>
<h1 id="gamehead">1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.
</h1>
<p>I learned that sequence of events is extremely important and that it is crucial to organize your coding so that you can see what you are doing.</p>
<h1 id="gamehead">2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h1>
<p>There were some problems with the game not working properly, but they were fixed with vigorous trial and error.</p>
<h1 id="gamehead">3. What aspects of your game do you like best?</h1>
<p>I liked the concept of the game and how the difficulty increases. I also like how there is a lot of suspense because it is inspired by another game.</p>
<h1 id="gamehead">4. If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h1>
<p>I would implement an anti-cheat system and also do some bugfixes on the end screen.</p>
